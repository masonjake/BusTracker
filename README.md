# Real Time Bus Tracker

This project will show the real time location of different buses in Boston.  This project uses the mapbox api to create a map. It then takes the information from the Boston MTA and maps out the coordinates of the buses on the map.  The function is called recursively so the location is constantly updating.

## How to run:

1. Create a directory and clone the code onto your machine.
2. Insert your mapbox api key into the `mapboxgl.accessToken` variable.
3. Open index.html in the browser of your choice.

## Features coming soon:

1. The website will have more styling featues coming soon such as an element that tracks and follows user mouse position.
2. There will be a fun bus animation that shows a bus traveling across the screen.
3. There will be a feature that allows the user to click on the marker for the bus and it will highlight and display its route on the map.
